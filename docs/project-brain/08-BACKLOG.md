16. `HCODER-WO-0016` Trusted Workspace & Git Read Surface — **PROMOTION CANDIDATE**. Technical head `07dda00f7371bcb02158f0c26258b03fa0dec88d` passed Governance #203, Desktop Shell #39 and HEDS review `5213079423`; canonical merge/post-merge proof remains pending.

## Product capability roadmap
- **Desktop Shell/UI:** governed native substrate exists; WO-0016 adds explicit user-mediated workspace opening plus truthful bounded workspace/Git/evidence reads.
- **Model Capability Negotiator:** normalize provider/model capabilities and expose only verified capability state.
- **Hive Skills Engine:** discover, verify, install, version, activate, compose and learn reusable skills under the permission boundary.
- **Agent Runtime:** long-running task UX over the approved resumable runtime, checkpoints, plans, subagents and evidence.
- **Provider/Model Router:** OpenCode Go first-class plus replaceable providers, quality/cost/latency policy and per-task selection.
- **Git / Workspace / Shell:** read-only workspace/Git/evidence foundation is WO-0016; file mutation, Git mutation and terminal execution require later governed permit-aware capability adapters.
- **Computer surface:** live view and privileged control remain separate; mutation stays behind permit-gated Cua executors.
- **Remote Hive Control:** future HIGH_ASSURANCE authenticated/encrypted subsystem with revocation, audit and emergency stop; never expose raw RDP/VNC/Cua publicly.
- **Integrated Build Loop:** code -> test -> launch -> observe -> computer-use validate -> repair -> evidence -> PR/review.
- **Packaging/Updates:** signed Windows packaging, controlled acquisition, update channels, rollback and health diagnostics.

## Next NECESSARY product increment after canonical CP-0016
Fresh source-check must prioritize truthful live **runtime/provider/permission read state** through existing Hive-owned adapters before enabling their corresponding mutation surfaces. It must reuse the already-approved Python runtime/provider/task engines rather than duplicate them.

Any next increment must preserve:
- presentation state as non-authoritative;
- explicit provenance and UNKNOWN/DISCONNECTED/DEGRADED instead of fake readiness;
- `UI -> Application/Orchestrator -> Permission & Control Plane -> Capability Adapters`;
- no generic shell execution or arbitrary filesystem/desktop mutation;
- disabled mutation controls until a later governed permit-gated path exists.

## Open residual work
- Rust dependency refresh/target-chain analysis for the 7 RustSec warning-class advisories.
- Stricter desktop CSP than `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`.
- Native picker/full desktop interaction E2E, Windows reparse fixture, visual screenshot/pixel validation and accessibility automation.
- Stronger handle-relative/no-follow workspace capability I/O before privileged file/Git mutation.
- Installer/signing/updater/release packaging and rollback/roll-forward proof.
- Live runtime/provider/permission adapter integration.
- Final project license and release attribution decision.

Only the next NECESSARY increment enters automatically after CP-0016 is canonical and a new governed Work Order/Context Lock are created.
